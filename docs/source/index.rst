Project Goals
-------------

Handshake gives people the ability to hold self-sovereign, decentralized, yet human-readable names. These names are
scarce, and will become extremely valuable over time. People need a venue to trade these names without compromising
on their sovereignty. Our prime directive is to become that venue.

A trading venue is useless, however, if users find it too difficult to trade on it. This is why our secondary
directive is to make ShakeDex accessible to as many people as possible.

Finally, we aim to add additional utility to Handshake names. The uses for decentralized naming go far beyond
hosting unstoppable websites. We want to help ShakeDex users find those uses and build them.
